          Through this portfolio I want to take you through my journey from
          starting as a beginning novice to my goal as a full fledged programmer.
           With my experience in management in the food industry, to creating and
            maintaining international import/export companies, I have a wide
            variety of skills and experiences to draw upon to inspire my code
            and designs. I'm driven, always curious, and constantly seeking to improve my skills.
        </p>

          One of my lifelong passions have been gaming and I'm hoping through
          Epicodus I can aquire the skills necessary to break into the game
          industry. Bethesda Softworks games have been a huge inspiration and
          it's my dream to design an open-world game such as the Elder Scrolls
          series.
